I decided to play Maplestory this summer, and I contributed a lot to hacking forums. 

This is a trainer I wrote that received over 6000 downloads. I stopped updating it once school had started.

**Googling "0aixz0r" covers most of my summer Maplestory hacking activities

Most of the hacking is written in Assembly. Scripts were written through the use of Cheat Engine's debugger.
