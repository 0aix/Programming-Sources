The Snake project is very recent. I wrote it as a simple program to teach Computer Programming club members. 
==============================================
Galactica.exe - An unfinished game written as a project for my Calculus class this year. I didn't finish it as I was sick (but I still got a 25/25). I deleted the source code because I was disappointed...
MouseCalibration.exe - precursor to a Mouse Calibration program. I lost the source after I reformatted my computer, but it's nothing complicated.
